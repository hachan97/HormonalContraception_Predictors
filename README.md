#  A machine learning approach: [Generational trends and predictors of hormonal contraceptive use in Germany](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp1.html)

## Abstract
The introduction of the contraceptive pill revolutionized women's reproductive health, but recent years have seen a decline in its use among younger women in Germany. This project investigates this trend using a machine learning approach.

### Key Contributions:
- Examine generational variation in hormonal contraceptive use across birth cohorts.
- Analyze the predictive power of 25 variables on hormonal contraceptive use using Random Forest and XGBoost models.
- Identify key predictors across cohorts and interpret prediction patterns, including non-linearities and interactions.
- Analyze data from the pairfam (Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics) study.

## Data Source:
This study utilizes data from the [pairfam](https://www.pairfam.de/en/data/) (Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics) for Germany.

## Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest
XGBoost
